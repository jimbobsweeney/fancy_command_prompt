### Hey, sportsfan!

Is there something missing in your life? Some deep-seated inner tension that you fear will never be resolved no matter how hard you try? Well, FEAR NOT! I know exactly what you need. I know you better than you know yourself! And I have the very thing to melt away all that unpleasantness that dogs you at every turn 'til you wish it would all just end:

### You need a FANCY COMMAND PROMPT.

This one displays the path in green, then the Git branch in blue, if you're in a directory for which you have a repository on the go. It even displays an asterisk to indicate when there's stuff waiting to be committed! Look! It's beautiful!

To get this working, take what's in the .bash_profile here and paste it into the .bash_profile in the root directory of your UNIX computer box. Then go `source ~/.bash_profile` to reload the profile.

**Note: you have to make a commit before it'll appear in the command prompt.**

### But wait, there's more!

No, there isn't.
